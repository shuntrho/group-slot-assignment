## This project is aimed making assigning people to time slots simple.

### Functional requirements:
- User can add people who will be taking part in an activity.
- Time slots for the activity can be added.
- System will assign people into time slots (usually two people per slot), based on their availability. People can be assigned more than once, however the assignment should be "fair" i.e. the system should aim for all people to be assigned the same number of times.
- People can be assigned to multiple subgroups with different priorities, which will determine people assigned to the same time slot.
- Defining time slots will be an ongoing process, so with new slots added participants should be assigned according to their preferences and history.
